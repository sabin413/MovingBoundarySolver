Here, I demonstrate a nobel numerical method to compute the solidification kinetics, such as rate of advancemet of the solid-liquid interface during solidifcation 
of a supercooled melt and resultiong unstable interface, patterns, etc.
I have provided a brief explanation of the underlying physics along with the code.
