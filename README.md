It demonstrates a novel numerical method I developed to numerically simulate the solidification kinetics (such as the rate of advancement of the solid-liquid interface during solidification 
of a supercooled melt, resulting in an unstable interface, patterns, etc).

I have briefly explained the underlying physics along with Python codes. Please feel free to contact me at sbn.adh@gmail.com if you want help in understanding the theory and implementing this method to solve your problem.
