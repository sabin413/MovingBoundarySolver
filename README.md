I demonstrate a novel numerical method to compute the solidification kinetics, such as the rate of advancement of the solid-liquid interface during solidification 
of a supercooled melt and resulting unstable interface, patterns, etc.
I have provided a brief explanation of the underlying physics along with the code.
